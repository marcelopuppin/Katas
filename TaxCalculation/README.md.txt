The following table is the current tax rates in Israel:
 
Tax 			Rate
Up to 5,070		10%
5,071 up to 8,660	14%
8,661 up to 14,070	23%
14,071 up to 21,240	30%
21,241 up to 40,230	33%
Higher than 40,230	45%

 
Here are some example answers:
 •5,000 –> 500
 •5,800 –> 609.2
 •9,000 –> 1087.8
 •15,000 –> 2532.9
 •50,000 –> 15,068.1
 
This problem is a bit tricky because the tax rate doesn’t apply to the whole sum, 
only to the part that is within the current rate.
